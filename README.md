Some solutions for AOC 2024.

# Usage

Tested with GHC 9.4.8 and Cabal 3.10.3.0.

Challenge inputs for each day go in `/inputs/{day}.txt` (day must be two characters long and zero padded, e.g. 01, 02) 

```
$ cabal run aoc2024 <day>
```

The `day` arg is a numerical index of the solution you want to get.
